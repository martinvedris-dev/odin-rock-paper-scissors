# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Simple rock paper scissors game that's part of The Odin Project curriculum. Project pages in the curriculum are [Project: Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) and [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).
With my current knowledge, this was not an easy project, but with the help of Google, StackOverflow, and a lot o writing in my notebook I managed to make it. I'm very proud even though it took me a little longer than I thought. This project showed me that every idea (simple or complex) can be presented on the Internet.


## Learning outcomes
 - I've learned how to add functionality to .html document with .js file
 - I've learned how to manipulate DOM
 - I've deepened my HTML and CSS knowledge
